copy and unzip z80board_template.zip into your kicad template directory.
In kicad ConfigurePaths, the variable KICAD_USER_TEMPLATE_DIR is the path of the directory 
where you should unzip the file.

Then you will be able to create a new project from a template, and select the User tab. There will be a project
called Z80.


note the .zip contains the directory so when you unzip it do not use the suggested default path or you will 
end up with 2 directory levels instead of 1.
